# Benchmark implementations

Two implementations of the multi-energy newtork benchmark are available:

* Folder [```cosim_disheatlib_pandapower```](./cosim_disheatlib_pandapower) provides a co-simulation based on [mosaik](https://mosaik.offis.de/), coupling a [DisHeatLib](https://github.com/AIT-IES/DisHeatLib) model, [pandapower](https://pandapower.readthedocs.io/) and stand-alone implementations of the controllers.
* Folder [```cosim_pandapipes_pandapower```](./cosim_pandapipes_pandapower) provides a co-simulation based on [mosaik](https://mosaik.offis.de/), coupling [pandapipes](https://pandapipes.readthedocs.io/), [pandapower](https://pandapower.readthedocs.io/), several stand-alone models and implementations of the controllers.
