# Benchmark Model Multi-Energy Networks

This repository contains the documentation for the multi-energy networks benchmark model developed in the ERIGrid 2.0 project. 

The folder [```Implementation-Files```](./Implementation-Files) includes two implementations of the benchmark in separate sub-folders. 

The folder [```PreCISE-Documentation```](./PreCISE-Documentation) contains the description of the model according to the PreCISE framework. 
The different subfolders are indexed according to the PreCISE template and the file [```PreCISE_ToC.pdf```](./PreCISE-Documentation/PreCISE_ToC.pdf) provides a brief description of each file.
