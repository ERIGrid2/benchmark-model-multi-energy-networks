[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5735005.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5735005)

This repository contains the documentation and reference implementations of the multi-energy networks benchmark model developed in the [ERIGrid 2.0] project. 

The folder [```implementation_files```](./implementation_files) includes two implementations of the benchmark in separate sub-folders. 

The folder [```PreCISE_documentation```](./PreCISE_documentation) contains the description of the model according to the PreCISE framework. 
File [```PreCISE_documentation/MENB_ToC.pdf```](./PreCISE_documentation/MENB_ToC.pdf) provides a brief description of each file.
